# Math Memoir

This repository is a personal archive of my mathematics problem-solving journey, mostly documented in LaTeX.

The motive behind the birth of this repo is to:
- Maintain a structured, version-controlled collection of solved problems.
- Track progress over time and revisit previous solutions.
- Serve as a personal reference and, in the future, potentially as a resource for others interested in problem-solving.

Each subject has its own folder, with individual problem solutions organized and compiled into PDFs. GitHub Actions are used to automatically generate updated PDFs whenever the repository is updated.

This is a solo project for personal growth although open to criticism and feedbacks.
